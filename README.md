### Image Inpainting with RBF Regression:

Suppose you’re given an image with missing or corrupted pixels, like the image above corrupted by red text. 
Inpainting is a process of predicting the corrupted pixels, for which we’ll use RBF regression.

![Restored image](https://github.com/HarryZ7G/MachineLearning11/blob/main/images/A1_restored.png?raw=true)

From left to right: (a) The original image. (b) Image restored by the algorithm.
