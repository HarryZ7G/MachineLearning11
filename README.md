## Assignment 1

### Part 1: Find the optimum L2 Coefficient
Find the optimum L2 Coefficient for each of the given data sets by finding the prediction error of each L2 Coeffificient value from 1 to 10, then select a single model by plotting with Matplotlib.

### Part 2: Image Inpainting with RBF Regression:
Given an image with missing or corrupted pixels, like the image (a) corrupted by red text. Inpainting is a process of 
predicting the corrupted pixels, for which implement RBF regression.

From left to right: (a) An image corrupted with red text. (b) The image restored by the algorithm.

## Assignment 2

Complete the implementation of a random decision forest classifier, then use it to train on two real-world datases.

**Occupancy Detection:**
Binary classification task with real-valued sensory inputs. The task is to detect whether an office is occupied based on light, 
temperature, humidity and CO2 measurements.

**Amazon Commerce Reviews**
Predict the author of a review on Amazon, given 1300 training pairs (feature vector, author ID), and 200 test points. 
The task is to choose optimal the hyper-parameters for the dataset.

## Assignment 3

### Part 1: Dimension reduction
Dimension reduction by implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Part 2: Implement EM-PCA
Implement EM-PCA, as EM-PCA runs much faster and achieve the same results.

## Assignment 4

Implement K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and K-Means++ clustering to cluter words based on their meaning and properties and visualize the data using mkWordClouds.
